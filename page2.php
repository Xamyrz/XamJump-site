        <p class="text"><font size="5">XamJump was a Minecraft parkour server based on the sprint while holding CTRL button, mouse movement and Space bar which allowed you to jump. The parkour maps were fully created by our staff and our community.</font></p>
        <br>
        <p class="text"><font size="5">The whole concept of this server was to finish parkour courses and level up your character to unlock new levels that were getting harder and on the way you could get into the leaderboards of top 10 in the parkour course by getting a fastest time.</font></p>
        <br>
        <p class="text"><font size="5">Achievements and AutoEvents were added later on after the server launched, the achievemnts were simple and required player to finish a specific course 10 times or get to a the Top 10 in the leaderboards of a course. AutoEvents was a really cool idea that we had as it meant that people could level up their characters way faster by hopping into an event where a course had to be done 5 times and the first person to finish the course 5 times got X amount of experience added to their account. This made a server a bit more competitive.</font></p>
